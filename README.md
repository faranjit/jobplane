`jobplane` is a multi-tenant distributed job execution platform built around a clear **control plane / data plane** architecture. It allows teams to define background jobs, enqueue executions, and run them in isolated environments through a pluggable runtime layer (e.g. containers, raw processes, or orchestration backends) without coupling execution logic to core system state. The Control Plane provides a stateless HTTP API for job definitions, execution lifecycle management, and observability, while the Data Plane consists of high-performance workers that schedule, execute, and monitor jobs under strict concurrency, timeout, and reliability guarantees. PostgreSQL is used as the system of record and transactional queue, enabling strong consistency, at-least-once execution, and simplified operations. The project is designed to mirror real-world platform and infrastructure systems, emphasizing explicit ownership, multi-tenancy, and production-grade execution semantics over framework-heavy abstractions.
